<H1>Intro</H1>
<p>I have finally started working on the Tetris game project I have been thinking of for a long time. I plan on this being the ultimate Tetris game, with all types of modes, music selection, and options.</p>
<p>I am going to need to develop an advanced engine and wait a few years for computing technology to catch up, as this is one powerful version of Tetris. Cool things are in this version that have never been done before, like softbody tetris, Tetris with 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 sided pieces, color customization, printing, and more.</p>
<p>Today, I am just laying down the foundation, putting some standard resources and references in, and decent documentation to get the project going. This is going to be my first highly detailed game. I might not develop every day, but I will try.</p>
