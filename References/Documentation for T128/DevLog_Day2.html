<H1>Developer documentation for Tetris 128 > Developer log day 2</H1>
<H2>=========================================================</H2>
<H3>
<a href="Tetris128DeveloperDocumentationHome.html">Go back</a>
<p>Today wasn't a productive day for this project. I am trying to figure out how I am going to get this to work. It is a huge goal, and will require a large team. I can't do this by myself</p>
<p>It is also going to take up a lot of memory, due to the fact that there are 11,006 Polyominoes in Mega Mix mode, and the softbody Tetris mode with really good gravity and graphics</p>
<p>Development might pause frequently, but I am going to keep giving this program a try</p>
